## How to run the app

In the  terminal run `npm install` which will install all the dependencies in the `package.json` file and then run `npm start` which will start your development server on `localhost:3000`.

## Point to note

You will notice that I'm making `http` requests - and not `https`. That's because the free tier doesn't allow you to send `https` requests. Upgrade your tier in order to be able to do that.
